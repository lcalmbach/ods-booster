# 📖 Overview  

[OpenDataSoft (ODS)](https://opendatasoft.com) is an **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)** platform widely used by the Open Data community for storing and publishing datasets. While ODS provides a **REST API** for direct data access, performance issues can arise for large datasets. In such cases, datasets need to be replicated to a more performant storage solution, either **locally** or in a **cloud database**.  

### ⚡ What is ODS-Booster?  
**ODS-Booster** is a demonstration application that showcases multiple strategies for caching ODS datasets to enhance data access performance. It supports storing ODS datasets in:  
- **Local storage** as Parquet files  
- **Azure Blob Storage**  
- **Snowflake** as a database table  

This application demonstrates **data synchronization techniques** with various storage types. **It must be adapted** if you are working with different data sources (ODS) or target storage solutions (Azure, Snowflake, etc.).  

### 🌍 Try the Demo  
You can test the application at **[ODS-Booster Streamlit App](https://ods-booster.streamlit.app/)**.  

💡 **Note:** The demo runs on a **free Streamlit account** with **limited memory and disk space**. It primarily demonstrates how data can be transferred and synchronized across different storage solutions.  

### 🏗️ Practical Considerations  
- If you plan to **run ETL tasks** on your own data, **cloud resources** are needed based on the dataset size.  
- For **local testing**, running the app on your **own machine** is recommended, as memory is much cheaper locally.  
- For **production environments**, consider using **serverless functions** to sync your data **regularly** with your ODS store.

## 🚀 Usage  

### Prerequisites  
To run the application, you need:  
✅ An **Azure** account (for Blob Storage)  
✅ A **Snowflake** account (for database storage)  

### Running the application  
Once your environment is set up, configure your storage settings (Azure, Snowflake) and execute the script:  

```sh
(.venv)$ streamlit run app.py
```
